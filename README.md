## IVCA: Inter-Relation-Aware Video Complexity Analyzer

📚IVAC is an inter-relation-aware video complexity analyzer (IVCA) as an extension to the [VCA ](https://github.com/cd-athena/VCA) project. The IVCA incorporates inter-frame relations, namely motion and reference structure to enhance the video complexity analysis accuracy.

🛠️Our project is based on the VCA project, and you can refer to the [VCA ](https://github.com/cd-athena/VCA) repo for build guidance and more information.
